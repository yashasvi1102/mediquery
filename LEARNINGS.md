# MediQuery Learnings Log

A running log of decisions, mistakes, and surprises during this 6-week build.

## Day 1
- Chose DuckDB over Snowflake to avoid 30-day trial expiry killing the demo later.
- Kept Python 3.13 (every library this project uses supports 3.13 in 2026).
- Installed Java 17 Temurin for Synthea. Java is only needed by Synthea, nothing else.
- GitHub username: yashasvi1102.
- Synthea FHIR bundles are JSON arrays under "entry". Each entry wraps a resource.
- Patients have ONE Patient resource but DOZENS of Encounter/Condition/Observation resources.
- ICD-10 codes are at entry[].resource.code.coding[0].code, but SNOMED codes are also present at coding[1]. Parser must pick the right system.
- File size correlates with patient age - older = more medical history = bigger bundle.
## Day 2
- Set up Python venv in project root, not inside synthea/. Keeping our code separate from the tool that generates data is cleaner.
- One Synthea patient = 500-1200 entries across ~19 resource types. Way more data per patient than expected.
- Bryan958 had more Procedures (176) than Observations (103), which is unusual - most patients have many more vitals/labs than procedures.
- Of 19 resource types Synthea emits, only 6 matter for this project: Patient, Encounter, Condition, MedicationRequest, Observation, Procedure. The other 13 are billing/admin noise.
